Hi! This is the personal blog for Huanjia Wang.

My industry experience is mainly focused on `frontend development`. I also accomplished tons of backend tasks, too. `Linux`, `shell scripting`, `api development`, etc, all of these won't be a problem for me.

I served some well-known companies like [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), [PDD(Pinduoduo Inc - ADR)](https://www.temu.com/), [SAP](https://www.sap.com/), and so on.

Now I am studying at `DePaul University` majoring in `Computer Software Engineering`. I shall graduate around 06/2024 or 12/2024(might depend on the economy situation in the US).

I am totally open to `summer internships` concerning software development. Referral or invitations in such a `cold winter`(talking economically) is more than welcome.

You can also find me in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/berrywhj/) or [github](https://github.com/berrywhj).
